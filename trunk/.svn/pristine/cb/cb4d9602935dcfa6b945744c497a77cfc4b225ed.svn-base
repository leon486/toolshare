Bugs:
-There is no edit shed option implemented.
-When adding a new tool, you should probably be able to select all sheds in your share zone to share your tool from it.
-In the request tool form the tool doesnt scale well.
-When reviewing requests the system should not the lender approve two reservations on conflicting dates.
-Show the location of the tool (shed, etc)

Features:
+We could add more community statistics
+While creating sheds you shouldn't specify a state or zipcode, they should be taken from the currently logged in user
+Add serial number on tools model
+Make the tool category field a drop-down (combo box)
+Sheds should take the default pickup arrangement from the user model.
+Format the forms, make them more presentable
